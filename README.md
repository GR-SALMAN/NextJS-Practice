This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### NextJS Basics: Loading massage..

---

_This repository is a practice of the first NextJS topic: Loading._ All source files are placed in the 'app' folder.

Here if somehow the internet is slow or the content is too big to load, you just have to put a loading massage till the content has come.
All you have to do do, just at the rout folder as we did earlier as layput/page.jsx we just have to create a file named 'loading'
just there write your loading massage and then save it. nextJS will automatically render the loading massage to the children sagement

```
function itemsloading() {
  return <div> Homapage loading....</div>;
}

export default itemsloading;

```
